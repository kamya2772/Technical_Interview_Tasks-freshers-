# Technical_Interview_Tasks-freshers-
A list of possible real-world tasks that might be given in the Practical round

This document outlines potential tasks for the practical round of your interview. The goal of this round is to assess your hands-on development skills in either Frontend (React.js/Next.js) or MERN Stack technologies. You will be asked to complete one of the following types of tasks.

## ✅ Frontend Tasks (React.js / Next.js)

You might be asked to build a small application or feature using React.js. Examples include:

* **Todo App or Form App:** Develop a basic application to manage a list of todos or a form to collect user input. This will test your understanding of component state management, event handling, and rendering dynamic content.
* **Fetch and display data from a public API:** Utilize a public API to fetch data and display it in a user-friendly format. This will assess your ability to work with asynchronous operations and handle API responses.
* **Implement pagination, filtering, or search:** Enhance a data display component by adding functionality to paginate through data, filter it based on certain criteria, or implement a search bar.
* **Styling with TailwindCSS or basic CSS:** Style your application or components using either TailwindCSS or fundamental CSS. This will evaluate your ability to create visually appealing and well-structured user interfaces.

## ✅ MERN Stack Tasks

You might be asked to build a small full-stack application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Examples include:

* **Small CRUD app (e.g., Notes, Tasks):** Develop a basic application allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data (such as notes or tasks). This will test your understanding of building both the frontend and backend components and how they interact.
* **Basic authentication (login/signup form):** Implement user authentication functionality, including creating login and signup forms and handling user sessions.
* **API creation with Node.js + Express:** Build a simple RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle data requests.
* **Use MongoDB for storing user input:** Utilize MongoDB to store and retrieve data for your application.

## ✅ Other Possibilities

In addition to the above, you might encounter tasks such as:

* **Fix bugs in given code:** You will be provided with a piece of existing code containing bugs and asked to identify and resolve them. This will test your debugging and problem-solving skills.
* **Convert a static HTML layout into React:** You will be given a static HTML structure and asked to convert it into functional React components. This will assess your understanding of componentization and JSX.
* **Build a small component from a Figma or screenshot:** You will be provided with a design (either from Figma or a screenshot) and asked to implement the corresponding React component. This will test your ability to translate visual designs into code.
